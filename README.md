# Python Module Challenge

In this challenge, I demonstrate the use of ```import``` function to access an external python module file.
The module that we access greets users of the application and introduces them to the Fizz Buzz challenge game.

## To run the application local
The following instructions assumes you already have python downloaded and added it to your system environment variables. 

1. Navigate to the main Github repository
2. Click the the **CODE** button at the top of this page
3. Select download as zip file 
4. Unzip the file and open a terminal for the project directory
5. Open a terminal window for your project directory
7. To finally run the project type the command ```python run.py ```
